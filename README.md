### Phase 1 — Data Collection
Raw data was gathered from various sources including structured files (CSV, JSON) and external APIs. Data quality checks were performed during ingestion to ensure reliability.

### Phase 2 — Cloud Storage & Processing
Data was loaded into **Google BigQuery** for scalable processing. SQL queries were used to clean, transform, and structure datasets ready for analysis.

### Phase 3 — Analysis & Visualization
**Looker Enterprise** was used to build interactive dashboards and conduct exploratory data analysis, applying storytelling principles to surface meaningful patterns.

### Phase 4 — Insight Activation
Findings were packaged and presented to stakeholders in a clear, actionable format — translating technical analysis into business recommendations.
